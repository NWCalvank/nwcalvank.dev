# NWCalvank.dev

My developer blog with almost no content. And crappy styling.

The content is written in Markdown, and uses
[zero-md](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md) for runtime Markdown-to-HTML.

## Getting Started

If you have [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) installed, simply run:

```
serve
```

Otherwise:

```
$ npm ci
$ npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the blog.
