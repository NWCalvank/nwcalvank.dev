# NWCalvank.dev

My developer blog, using the Gatsby Starter Blog template and taking
inspiration from Dan Abramov's [overreacted](https://overreacted.io/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (just don't use v13 and you should be fine)

## Getting Started

```
$ make setup
$ make run
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to see the blog.

## Making Your Own Blog

This repo is living in the house that Gatsby built. All I've really added are
the blog posts and a little bit of logic to automatically deploy to a
pre-configured S3 bucket on AWS.

I'd prefer that you don't rip off all of my blog posts, but feel free to take
whatever else you find valuable from this repo.
